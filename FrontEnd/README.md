## Get started

This project uses NextJS (https://nextjs.org/) with TypeScript, SCSS, Redux, SWR, and some other tools.

To get started, clone this repo and run `yarn` or `npm i` to install all necessary NPM packages. Then run
one of the below scripts to get the code running (probably `dev`).

## Available Scripts

### `yarn dev` or `npm dev`

Runs `next dev` which starts Next.js in **development** mode. <br />
Page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

Runs `next build` which builds the application for production usage. <br />
Need to run this before running the `start` script.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs `next start` which starts a Next.js **production** server. <br />
Need to run the `build` script before running this.
